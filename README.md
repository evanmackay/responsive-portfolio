# Responsive Portfolio

[https://evanmackay.github.io/responsive-portfolio/index.html](https://evanmackay.github.io/responsive-portfolio/index.html)

This is my responsive portfolio I created to give people an idea of who I am, what my work is like, and how they can reach me if they would like to contact me.

## Home Page
This is the home page for my Portfolio. It has an about me section to give people some basic information about myself, and the experience and reasons I have for full-stack web development. At the top is a navigation bar with links to my contact page, social media, and my portfolio.

## Contact Page
This is the contact page that can be reached in the link in the menu-bar. On this page, people will eventually be able to send an email to me if they would like to get into contact with me about employment opportunities or anything else they would like to talk to me about.

## Portfolio Page
This is the page that will display the work I have completed. Eventually, I will have more to show here, but until then it will only display the first code I have worked on.

### Responsive Code
All the code in this work is responsive to the size of the screen that is being used to view the website. It was designed using the Twitter Bootstrap model and coded by me, Evan Mackay.
